# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Next.js 15 Fetch Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15 applications involving fetch requests: unhandled promise rejections.  The `about.js` file contains a fetch request that doesn't handle potential errors (like network issues or API errors). This can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a solution by using async/await and try...catch blocks to gracefully handle these errors.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the error if the API request fails (you can simulate this by using a wrong URL or temporarily making the API unavailable).

## Solution

The solution involves using try...catch blocks to handle potential errors during the fetch process, preventing crashes and displaying a user-friendly error message.
